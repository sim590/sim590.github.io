It has been a great experience and I\u0026rsquo;m very glad I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to make it. I\u0026rsquo;ve had the pleasure to contribute to a project showing very good promise for the future of communication: Ring. The words \u0026ldquo;privacy\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;freedom\u0026rdquo; in terms of technologies are being more and more present in the mind of people. All sorts of projects wanting to achieve these goals are coming to life each days like decentralized web networks (ZeroNet for e.g.), blockchain based applications, etc.\nDebian I\u0026rsquo;ve had the great opportunity to go to the Debian Conference 2016. I\u0026rsquo;ve been introduced to the debian community and debian developpers (\u0026ldquo;dd\u0026rdquo; in short :p). I was lucky to meet with great people like the president of the FSF, John Sullivan. You can have a look at my Debian conference report here.\nIf you want to read my debian reports, you can do so by browsing the \u0026ldquo;Google Summer Of Code\u0026rdquo; category on this blog.\nWhat I have done Ring is now in official debian repositories since June 30th. This is a good news for the GNU/Linux community. I\u0026rsquo;m proud to say that I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to contribute to debian by working on OpenDHT and developing new functionalities to reduce network traffic. The goal behind this was to finally optimize the data persistence traffic consumption on the DHT.\nGithub repository: https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/opendht\nQueries Issues:\n #43: DHT queries  Pull requests:\n #79: [DHT] Queries: remote values filtering 93: dht: return consistent query from local storage #106: [dht] rework get timings after queries in master  Value pagination Issues:\n #71: [DHT] value pagination  Pull requests:\n #110: dht: Value pagination using queries #113: dht: value pagination fix  Indexation (feat.

To do so we use our benchmark python module. We are able to analyse traffic and produce plots like this one:\nPlot: 32 nodes, 1600 values with normal condition test.  This particular plot was drawn before the enhancements. We are confident to improve the results using my work produced during the GSOC.\nTCP In the middle of the GSOC, we soon realized that passing from UDP to TCP would ask too much efforts in too short lapse of time. Also, it is not yet clear if we should really do that.\n","description":"","id":9,"section":"gsoc","tags":null,"title":"[GSOC] Final report","uri":"https://sim590.github.io/en/gsoc/final/"},{"content":"Week 10 \u0026amp; 11 During these two weeks, I\u0026rsquo;ve worked hard on paginating values on the DHT.\nValue pagination As explained on my post on data persistence, we\u0026rsquo;ve had network traffic issues. The solution we have found for this is to use the queries (see also this) to filter data on the remote peer we\u0026rsquo;re communicating with. The queries let us select fields of a value instead of fetching whole values. This way, we can fetch values with unique ids. The pagination is the process of first selecting all value ids for a given hash, then making a separate \u0026ldquo;get\u0026rdquo; request packet for each of the values.\n This feature makes the DHT more friendly with UDP. In fact, UDP packets can be dropped when of size greater than the UDP MTU. Paginating values will help this as all UDP packets will now contain only one value.\n #71 #110 #113  Week 12 I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on making the \u0026ldquo;put\u0026rdquo; request lighter, again using queries. This is a key feature which will make it possible to enable data persistence. In fact, it enables us to send values to a peer only if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t already have the value we\u0026rsquo;re announcing. This will substantially reduce the overall traffic. This feature is still being tested. The last thing I have to do is to demonstrate the reduction of network traffic.\n","description":"Jet lag \u0026 PHT","id":10,"section":"gsoc","tags":null,"title":"[GSOC] Week 10\u002611\u002612 Report","uri":"https://sim590.github.io/en/gsoc/week10-11-12/"},{"content":"Week 8 This particular week has been tiresome as I did catch a cold ;).

I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on making OpenDHT run properly when compiled with some failing version of Apple\u0026rsquo;s LLVM. I\u0026rsquo;ve had the pleasure of debugging obscure runtime errors that you don\u0026rsquo;t get depending on the compiler you use, but I mean very obscure.\n I have released OpenDHT 0.6.2! This release was meant to fix a critical functionality bug that would arise if one of the two routing table (IPv4, IPv6) was empty. This was really critical for Ring to have the 0.6.2 version because it is not rare that a user connects to some router not giving IPv6 address.\nFinally, I have fixed some minor bugs in my work on the queries.\n","description":"Jet lag \u0026 PHT","id":11,"section":"gsoc","tags":null,"title":"[GSOC] Week 8\u00269 Report","uri":"https://sim590.github.io/en/gsoc/week89/"},{"content":"During week 5, 6 and 7, I have been to the debian conference 2016.

This contributes greatly to the growth of the web of trust.\n I did exchange public key fingerprint with others. It was the first opportunity become more connected in the PGP web of trust. I think this is something that needs to make its way to the less technical people so that everyone can benefit from the network privacy features. There is support for some mail clients like Thunderbird, but I think there is still work to do there and mostly there is work to do about the opinion or point of view people have about encryption ; people don\u0026rsquo;t care enough and they don\u0026rsquo;t really know what encryption can do for them (digital signature, trust and privacy).\nRing now part of Debian During the first week at debcamp, Alexandre Viau, an employee at Savoir-Faire Linux and a also a Debian developer (DD for short), has packaged Ring for Debian. Users can now install Ring like so:\n1  $ sudo apt-get install ring   This is an important moment as more people are now going to easily try Ring and potentially contribute to it.\nPresentating Ring Alexandre Viau and I have been thinking about presenting Ring at debconf 2016.

You can see my profile on the Debian wiki here.\nImproving distributed and secure communication using free software This the title of my project for this summer. It sounds good, but what am I going to really do? Well, since I\u0026rsquo;m a student at Université du Québec à Montréal, I have had the opportunity to meet with the company Savoir-Faire Linux in Montreal last year and that\u0026rsquo;s when I found out about their exciting project: Ring.\n Ring is one of the few projects which bring communication confidentiality and freedom in the hands of the users.\nOpenDHT Ring is divided in multiple components as explained here: https://ring.cx/en/about/technical. The component I work on is called OpenDHT. This is the distributed hash table which enables Ring users to communicate in a decentralized network.\nI have already been working on this project for a year now, so you won\u0026rsquo;t see me posting reports where I say I have to find my way around in this project. In fact, I have contributed to rewriting a major part of the code for better maintainability.\nIn the begining of last summer, I was able to be part of a research association between Savoir-Faire Linux and Université du Québec à Montréal. We have been working on adding two major features to OpenDHT.\nShort introduction to Distributed Hash Tables OpenDHT is based on the Kademlia design. If you know about DHTs, you are aware that they define the notion of distance using the XOR metric. This makes the tuple (H_n, xor) a metric space, where H_n is the space of identifier keys of length n. This way, you can find an identifier be the closest to a target hash than the rest of the nodes in the network.\n In order to find some data that is associated with some hash h, you have to find the nodes in the network for which the distance between their hash identifier and the target hash h is minimized. The group of nodes which are the closest to the target hash (OpenDHT allows up to 8 nodes) will hold data for that hash.\nData persistence Let\u0026rsquo;s say you ask a group of 8 nodes to hold some data for a hash and you want the data to hold the whole time until its expiration time as come. If the group of 8 nodes change because that for some reason those nodes leave or others just arrive and have an id that is closer to the target hash than the initial group of 8 nodes. The data would then not be found on the new group of 8 nodes. A first and simple solution was to count on the initial creator of the value to periodically announce the value to the group of 8 nodes. However, what if this node leaves? This is one of the main problem that I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on solving since 2015. A first version of this was produced on September 2015. However, we experienced traffic issues and were forced to redesign the OpenDHT network requests engine. We are presently working on adding a Query feature that would enable filtering of data on remote nodes, hence substantially lowering the overall traffic produced by a response to a \u0026lsquo;get\u0026rsquo; request.\nIndexation During the last year, I have also been working on the design of a solution for the use case of indexation. In a more technical way, this is the capability to find data by providing a map where its key is a string field and the mapped value is the value associated to that field, much like in a form. This could help find data for which you don\u0026rsquo;t know the hash, but you have specific information about its content. In other words, this would be a search engine for OpenDHT. I have already created a working, but still in progress, version of this. You can find it on http://opendht.net, on the index branch. Now, Nicolas Reynaud (kaldoran) is contributing to this during the GSOC.\nRoadmap As I explained on my page on the Debian Wiki, I am going to work on:\n Developing new functionalities in OpenDHT aiming at reducing overall generated traffic. Maintenance and optimization of the OpenDHT code in general. Optimizing data persistence solution over the distributed hash table. Merge (1) in the Ring daemon component in order to benefit from lower traffic in Ring. Make OpenDHT use TCP protocol instead of UDP. This is going to reduce code complexity and enhance robsutness of the DHT.
